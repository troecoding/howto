# create a new directory, open it and create a new git repository
git init

#create a working copy of a local repository by running the command
git clone /path/to/repository

# when using a remote server, your command will be
git clone username@host:/path/to/repository

# workflow
# your local repository consists of three "trees" maintained by git. 
#1) Working Directory which holds the actual files. 
#2) Index which acts as a staging area 
#3) the HEAD which points to the last commit you've made.

# add & commit
# You can propose changes (add it to the Index) using
git add <filename>
git add *

# This is the first step in the basic git workflow. To actually commit these changes use
git commit -m "Commit message"

#Now the file is committed to the HEAD, but not in your remote repository yet.
git push origin master


#exclude files/folders from git
echo '<filename/folder>' > .gitignore
